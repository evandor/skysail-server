= Idea

Layout of directories:

== config dir

application.conf typically resides in /config

== docker

Default configuration for docker. Will be copied by build script into release folder
and picked up by the Dockerfile.

== local

The configuration to be used when running from the IDE.

E.g. in server.website.ide.bndrun:

skysail.config.path            = config/local
logback.configurationFile.path = config/local

== standalone

The configuration to be used when from a plain jar (without config directory next to it).
