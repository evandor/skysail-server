== Introduction: skysail...

...is: a *modular*, *domain-centric* and *RESTful BaaS* (Backend as a Service)

(that you can host yourself)

The overall goal of skysail is to provide you with an environment where you can
create typical backend logic in a generic, quick way with as little dependencies
as possible. This makes skysail suited for prototypes, first of all, but I hope
that this approach - even though very generic - is good enough for production
ready applications as well.

*Typical backend logic covered by skysail*:

* Authentication / Authorization
* Security aspects (like injections)
* Configuration
* Validation
* Documentation
* Persistence

We have some more things skysail could help you with:

* User Management
* HTML Rendering (Template Engine)
* Generic Client GUI
* Prototyping
* and - calling other APIs

A skysail backend does not only serve JSON to be used by some client, it creates
a generic web GUI so that you can actually use and validate your implementation
directly with a browser.

Please check this site for the current implementation status of the above
features (todo).

Now, let's explain the main buzz-words from the definition above:

=== Modularity
skysail is a collection of OSGi bundles, depending on other bundles, and
defining an API for domains like authentication, security, persistence and
so on. If some API implementation does not fulfil your needs, it is easy to
replace it with your own implementation.

=== Domain-Centric
skysail lets you concentrate on your business (or domain) logic. Http Server,
database, configuration setup and the like are already there. Just use them.
Or replace them with an implementation more suited for your needs.

=== RESTful
skysail concentrates on the backend and tries to stick to RESTful principles.

=== BaaS
skysail is a Backend-as-a-Service.

=== Self-Hosting
The difference to many other BaaS, you can download and run skysail on your
own machines.

== Why not use X/Y/Z?

Apart from being deployable as a *single jar* file, skysail supports *true modularity*.
That means, contrary to for example _Spring_, you have dynamic class and service
discovery, not just a static one (when the application is started). Replacing a
bundle with a new version or even a new implementation becomes trivial (apart
from writing the new bundle maybe ;)). The system can react to changes, which
could be a new additional bundle, or stopping a bundle, so that its services
will become unavailable.
