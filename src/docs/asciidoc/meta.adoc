== About

This document contains references to all available documentation about
skysail.

While this is currently served at http://jenkins.twentyeleven.de/view/skysail-core/job/skysail-server.multibranch/job/release%252F0.0/All_Documentation/,
this location is likely to change.

The complete documentation is a collection of many documents, bundled together
for various audiences. So, for example, the _developer documentation_ is a subset of
all documents which are relevant for developers, whereas skysail users will have
their own "subset", the _skysail user documentation_. Like this, it is easy to reuse
and maintain documentation for different audiences.

You, as a reader, have to choose the kind of documentation you are interested in
(that is, you have to decide about your type of role as a reader).

If you are interested in the current version, check the next paragraph for the
available types of documentation.
