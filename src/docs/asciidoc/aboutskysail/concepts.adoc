In some way, skysail is just a set of concepts.footnote:[When you create something like a library or any kind of software others might want to use, you have to make a lot of decisions. Some of those might be easy - for example, picking a specific programming language. Others, like deciding if you really want to depend on other libraries and/or frameworks (and which ones) are harder. And, of course, you have some kind of problem in mind you want to solve.
So, in the end, you decide about a lot of things and create something which (hopefully) is useful - but only to people having this kind of problem, using that specific programming language and have a similar set of dependencies as you.
This chapter is about the decisions I've made.
All the concepts like "Applications", "Business Logic" and "Request Processing" - they might be valuable to only a small set of people. Still, I think these concepts are useful to solve problems I am confronted with, and I am happy to discuss (and adjust) them. Maybe they are useful to somebody else as well - hopefully, as this is the reason I started this in the first place.
The two big decisions right at the beginning were:
the programming language (Scala (although the first versions of skysail have been created using Java))
and the "framework" (OSGi with bndtools)
For those still reading on ;):
Picking this combination has a few implications: Actually, the programming language is not really restricted to Scala: You can use any language running on the Java Virtual Machine (like Java, Groovy, Clojure, ...). And, there is a clean modularization between the various parts. New Applications can be deployed into a running installation without restarting. If you are afraid to do this in production, you'll still love it in development. Dependencies are well-expressed and clean.
Round about a hundred bundles for a typical skysail installation seem a lot. But it's not: you'll get the server (jetty), a database (orientdb), serialization features (jackson) and validation stuff (hibernate). And more. Using OSGi let's you pick between various implements of specific features easily (for example, where do you store your users, if at all) - and, if you don't find what you are looking for - implement it yourself. Replace the implementation you are not happy with, and it will work.
And: your deployable, it's just a single jar file. You start it like "java -jar myskysail.installation.jar". That's it. Database and server included.

== Applications

NOTE: When we refer to "Application" in this documentation, what is usually
mean is a *SkysailApplication*.

When it comes to skysail, as a developer, you can extend (and/or) fix its core functionality, or you can create Applications.

An application is a cohesive unit (in DDD: a bounded context) of functionality, expressed as a domain model, the associated business logic and made available to the outside world as a set of RESTful endpoints. And, it is an OSGi bundle.

This bundle can be deployed into the skysail server, and, given its dependencies are matched, its endpoints will be available for provisioning and consumption.

Overview
to be done

Configuration
There are (at least) two ways to configure an application: There's the general one, which can be applied to all applications and contains definitions, for example, for CORS configuration. And then, often, you might need application-specific configurations, for example file paths or database access tokens.

General Configuration
This kind of config is described here.

Application-Specific Configuration
Let's use an example here: let's assume we have an application which utilizes the spotify API. So we need to configure a clientId, a clientSecret and the redirectUrl. This information should not be hardcoded, we don't even want to put it in version control. What we do is to define a configuration description and a configuration provider:

=== Creating a new Application

==== Prerequisites

You need a bundle first (todo)

==== The Activator

The typical activator for a skysail backend application will look like this:

```
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import domino.DominoActivator
import io.skysail.api.persistence.DbService
import io.skysail.server.RoutesCreatorTrait
import io.skysail.server.app.ApplicationProvider
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory

class DemoActivator extends DominoActivator {

  var app: DemoApplication = _

  whenBundleActive {
    whenServicePresent[DbService] { dbService =>
      app = new DemoApplication(dbService)
      app.providesService[ApplicationProvider]
    }
  }
}

```

==== The Application

The Activator is executed when the containing bundle is installed, and, in this case,
once a DbService is available, a new DemoApplication is created, which, in turn, will
provide services of its own (ApplicationProvider).

So, additionally to the Activator, we need a new BackendApplication:

````
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import akka.http.scaladsl.server.PathMatcher
import akka.http.scaladsl.server.PathMatchers._
import io.skysail.domain.routes.RouteMapping
import io.skysail.server.RoutesCreatorTrait
import io.skysail.server.app.{ApplicationProvider, BackendApplication}
import org.apache.felix.bundlerepository.RepositoryAdmin
import org.osgi.framework.BundleContext

class DemoApplication(bundleContext: BundleContext, routesCreator: RoutesCreatorTrait, system: ActorSystem, repoAdmin: RepositoryAdmin) extends
  BackendApplication(bundleContext, routesCreator, system) with ApplicationProvider {

  override def name = "demo"

  override def desc = "Skysail Demo Application"

  override def routesMappings = {
    val root: PathMatcher[Unit] = PathMatcher("demo") / PathMatcher("v1")
    List(
      RouteMapping("/bms", root / PathMatcher("bms") ~ PathEnd, classOf[ReposResource])
    )
  }

}
```
